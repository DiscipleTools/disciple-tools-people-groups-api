1,C0008,Albanian,"Albanians are a nation and ethnic group native to Albania and neighboring countries. They speak the Albanian language. More than half of all Albanians live in Albania and Kosovo. Albanians suffered until 1990 under one of the most repressive Communist regimes in Europe. All religions were banned. By the time the Communist government fell, the number of evangelicals had dwindled nearly to zero. Since then, mission activity both in Albania and Kosovo has seen significant response.","-- Patrick Johnstone, The Future of the Global Church, p. 189",Patrick Johnstone,None,A003,2003-10-30T00:00:00+00:00,2012-04-26T00:00:00+00:00,1
2,C0015,"Arab, Levant","The Levant Arab people cluster encompasses people groups that originate from the Fertile Crescent between the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean--extending across Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian territories.

Some ethnologists consider the Makua to be a subgroup of the Yao.

6,C0042,Beja,"The Beja are one of the major ethnic groups of Sudan, Eritrea, and western Ethiopia. Savage wars in the 1970s and 1980s drove most of the Eritrean Beja into Sudan. There are also tens of thousands of Beja in southern Egypt. The Beja are divided into a number of groups and tribes. 

Those Beja living in the northern region make their living raising camels and sheep, as well as producing grains on a small scale; farther south they also raise cattle. The Beja living in the Gash and Tokar deltas of the Barka River are commercial and subsistence farmers, raising cotton and grain.
